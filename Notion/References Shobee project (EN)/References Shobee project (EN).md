**Short synopsis  
  
**

A banished lord lives reclusively in his fortress, after losing all his allies, his territory and his honor. An unexpected event disturbs his rest and awakens his anger. From now on, he is only inhabited by one goal : to take revenge and to clear his honor.

In its form, the story is presented as a tale inspired by the oral traditions of southern Morocco, with a narrator and alternating moments of fiction and music.

Shobee is this fallen lord who wakes up as a wolf-man, thirsty for revenge. The men surrounding him, with their impure hearts, are creatures of bestiality whose faces are never seen.

Idea: the story of this fallen king is told through a tapestry, with pictorial elements identified in the tapestry style of Souss (southern Morocco)

**The cage of Rogui Bou Hmara**

Bou Hmara (_The man on a female donkey_) was an insurgent who wavered the central power by conquering a large part of eastern Morocco. Stopped in his conquest by the Rifans, he was captured by the Sultan's army and transferred to Fes where he was executed in the public square, butchered and then delivered to the animals.

In the public imagination, he is this man transported in a cage and humiliated in the public square.

**7alqa — Figure of the storyteller / the jester**

The oral tradition is of fundamental importance in Moroccan culture. It is probably one of the only parts of this culture that has not been modified, arranged or influenced by colonial thought. By its oral nature, the writings of all anthropologists, researchers, linguists and philosophers that came during the french protectorate had no hold over this specific culture.

  

In this vivid tradition, one figure stands out above all others, that of the 7layqi, the one who tells the 7alqa (_halqa_). During half of the year, he travels from douar to douar, from remote countryside to hidden mountains in search of new stories. The rest of the time, he goes to the city to tell these stories in the midst of large gatherings (notably on the Jamaa El Fna square in Marrakech, in the moussems or in the souks). He can also recite poems and even sing. We can find this character in the work of Tayeb Saddiki or Ahmed Bouanani.  
  
  
_Tayeb Saddiki - El Harraz (1968)_  
El Harraz is a play that laid the foundations of modern Moroccan theater and influenced the entire creative scene of the time. Notably, Nass El Ghiwane - the most influential Moroccan group in history - is featured in the play. Tayeb Saddiki incorporates the malhoun (a Moroccan medieval song) in the modern comedy.

_Ahmed Bouanani - Le Mirage (1979)_  
The Mirage (  
_Assarab_) is the only film by Moroccan filmmaker Ahmed Bouanani. The character of Ali Ben Ali is a figure inspired by this tradition.  
  
[https://youtu.be/abZfa3X4So8?t=2113](https://youtu.be/abZfa3X4So8?t=2113)  
  
Today, this tradition lives on. Some 7layqi even have their own Youtube pages, like  
[Abdelmajid who operates in Jamaa El Fna square.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtsmdqRburo)

  
This figure is interesting to me. 7layqi do not have a very respected social rank (they are vagabonds, people who are mocked and laughed at). However, they have a social function and an essential influence on the population. Ibn Khaldoun describes the 7layqi in these terms : "The poet walks in front of the ranks and sings: his song would animate the solid mountains; he sends to seek death those who did not think of it". The author Henri Basset said during the French protectorate: "Today, they are the ones, these orchestras with their barbaric attire, going from village to village, who spread the most extraordinary noises and encourage the fight against the French in the agitated regions. One admires them, one listens to them. They are formidable agents of propaganda".  
  
This is similar to the figure of the jester in  
**Ran**. Faithful to his lord, the jester has a subordinate hierarchical position. However, through his humor and insolence, he ends up influencing his master's decisions. Worse, he gradually becomes a spiritual guide for him, appearing in the midst of the chaos as the only holder of the truth. He becomes the mirror of his lord's emotions.

**Painted sheeps  
  
**A painted sheep can also be a harbinger of things to come, as the tapestry mentioned earlier.

![[Capture_decran_2023-01-25_a_22.55.38.png]]

  

**The decoy  
  
**In **Ran**, the head of a rival lord is requested. The head is delivered, but it is a decoy (what is delivered is in fact a fox head). The same idea could be used with a wolf's head (which would symbolize Shobee).

**The end of a battle**

The end scene of **Kagemusha** shows a battlefield where men lie among dead horses and broken flags. This scene does not glorify war, but rather depicts it as a gigantic waste.

"No one can be victorious in such a disaster. The weak man gives in to the temptation of power and drags the world down with him. Armies kill each other, nature remains: Man is little in this world."
