This statement will grant the `SELECT` privilege on the `table_name` table to the `username` user. You can also grant the `SELECT` privilege on all tables in a schema using the following syntax:

```SQL
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
```

It is important to note that the `GRANT SELECT` statement requires the `SELECT` privilege on the table or view, as well as the `GRANT OPTION` privilege. If you do not have these privileges, you will need to be granted them by a user with the necessary privileges, or connect as the Oracle database owner (e.g. `SYSDBA`).
