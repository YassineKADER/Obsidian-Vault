**ACL** concerne les routeurs.
(ACL need to be configured in the closest router to the target network (destination))
acl standars:
access-list 1-99 prmit | deny network-ip geniric-masque
access-list 1-99 prmit | deny host "host-ip" | any
### Then move on to the interface

ip access-group 1-99 in/out

# ACL Etendue

Router (config) #access-list 101 permit ip host 192.168.3.2 any # permit other protocol to be used normaly
Router (config) #access-list 101 permit < protocol> ip any any # permit other devices with using all the protocols

deny the 192.168.3.0 network from acccessing to http on the host 192.168.1.3
![[Pasted image 20240319145056.png]] 
deny ping from host 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.1.2
![[Pasted image 20240319145649.png]]
deny a host from using tftp on the server

#### ACL NOMMER
##### ACL Standard
```bash 
  ip access-list standard BLOCK_HTTP
  permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255          ! Permet le trafic du réseau 192.168.1.0/24
  deny any                              ! Interdit tout autre trafic
```
##### ACL Etendue
```bash
ip access-list extended ALLOW_SSH permit tcp 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any eq 22    #Permet le trafic SSH depuis le réseau 10.0.0.0/8
  deny ip any any                                ! Interdit tout autre trafic

```
### Apply The ACL
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip access-group BLOCK_HTTP in ! Applique l'ACL BLOCK_HTTP en entrée sur l'interface

```
- **In**: When an ACL is applied "in" on an interface, it means that the ACL is applied to incoming traffic, i.e., traffic that is coming into the interface from the network. This includes traffic destined for the device or network behind the interface.
    
- **Out**: On the other hand, when an ACL is applied "out" on an interface, it means that the ACL is applied to outgoing traffic, i.e., traffic leaving the interface and going towards the network. This includes traffic originating from the device or network behind the interface.
    

### Examples:

1. **ACL Applied Inbound (In)**:
    
    - Suppose you have an ACL named "BLOCK_HTTP" that denies HTTP traffic and is applied inbound on an interface.
    - Traffic from external networks coming into the interface will be checked against this ACL.
    - For example, if a packet with destination port 80 (HTTP) arrives at the interface, the ACL will block it based on the deny rule.
2. **ACL Applied Outbound (Out)**:
    
    - Consider an ACL named "ALLOW_SSH" that permits SSH traffic and is applied outbound on an interface.
    - Traffic generated by devices behind the interface and destined for external networks will be checked against this ACL.
    - For instance, if a packet with source port 22 (SSH) is leaving the interface, the ACL will permit it based on the allow rule.
